# Response to Tina Zhong's Blog!

Hi Tina, thank you for your blog! It was really insightful and actually helped restore some of my faith in big companies and humanity. Reading about how Patagonia has prioritized environmental stewardship alongside its financial goals makes me believe that there still are companies that care. Especially, considering that Patagonia is such a large and reputable company it provides an example for other companies that you can prioritize the goals that your started out with and still make it big. 

I also really liked the strategies that your provided at the bottom to align profits with ethics. I think the most straightforward but one of the most important ones is to measure success by financial performance AND by social impact. If you tie overall sucess to one your original goals, then you will always be prioritizing your ethical values. Additionally, embedding social responsibility from the very beggining of the creation is going to be key to maintaining your values. I think it is similar to habits in real life. Say you are a student and you make it a habit to attend every lecture on time from the begining of the semester, this is much easier to maintain than trying to start going to lectures on time in the middle of the semester. Overall, I think you bring up some really good ideas throughout your blog Tina and it is a good reminder to all of us that there are successful companies out there that care!
