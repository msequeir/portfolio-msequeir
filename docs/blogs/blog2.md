# "How Booking.com Turned Clicks into Trips: The Power of A/B Testing"


In Lecture 13 we talked about A/B testing and I specifically found the Mr. Beast example really interesting. The fact that he was able to see a better user engagement from having thumbnails with a closed mouth is fascinating and might be worth a psychology study. With this in mind I set off to find other cool examples of when A/B testing has been utilized and a company that is known for their A/B testing is Booking.com. The company constantly experiments with buttons and displays messages to determine how best to engage the user.




A notable example I found was their inclusion of urgent messages such as "Only 1 room left!" or "This property was booked 5 minutes ago." Booking.com experimented with a few of these phrases to see which ones motivated users to complete bookings. By emphasizing scarcity and social proof (the phenomenon that people copy the actions of others to determine how to behave in a certain situation), they tapped into psychological triggers that encouraged-faster decision making.




The result of these experiments was a significant increase in conversion rates. Users were more likely to finalize bookings when they felt the urgency prompted by these messages. This is a prime example of how Booking.com uses A/B testing, not just to optimize aesthetics but to optimize profits and influence user behavior.


What sets Booking.com apart is the sheer scale of the testing they employ. They run thousands of these A/B tests every year which creates a continuous loop of feedback. Each test provides insightful info into the user experience and keeps them on the forefront of the travel industry. This highlights the importance of a data-driven approach and how examples of design testing are omnipresent whether we recognize it or not.
