## Learning from Mistakes: Real-Life Apps That Mismanaged Their Design Process
After today’s recap by the TAs highlighting the importance of everything we have learned thus far in the course (which is a lot) I started to think about trying to complete our project without this structure and honestly I don't know where I would have started. This got me thinking about the consequences of not having an organized design process and naturally this led me to try and explore some real life examples of such issues going wrong. Many real-life apps have failed to implement such processes, leading to significant user dissatisfaction and, in some cases, user backlash. Here are a few notable examples.  

## 1. Snapchat's Redesign Debacle
In 2018, Snapchat redesigned the app’s interface. The goal was to simplify it but it ended up upsetting many of its users. The reaction was so bad that Snapchat's price stock price tanked and the company decided to rollback some of the changes made. This highlights the importance of incorporating user feedback into a production push and the importance of iterative design techniques.    
  

## 2. Microsoft’s Windows 8
In 2012 Microsoft launched windows 8 with the goal of creating an experience that was unified across multiple devices. It resulted in an interface that alienated many users and left them confused. They tried to get rid of the Start menu and the tile-based layout (like we talked about in lecture) was also met with widespread criticism. Furthermore, Microsoft backtracked and reintroduced the Start menu and this again highlights the whole reason we created apps: The users! 
   

## 3. Yahoo’s Merging of Platforms
The last example I found was when Yahoo tried to integrate various services they provide into one platform. For example they tried to combine emails, finance, and news into a single platform and it failed miserably. There was even an MIT Article on it but I can no longer access it :( Essentially, users felt that their needs were not being considered and there was now a cluttered interface that was no longer easy to work with. It was just another chapter in the downfall of Yahoo. 



## Conclusion

These different examples showcase the importance of having a structured design process and make all the principles we learn in class so important. It’s easy to be lazy when designing features in the beginning but later on as we see in the above companies you can pay for it. Most importantly, it is about the user experience that is the most important! What other apps do you think have suffered from poor design processes? I’d love to hear your thoughts!
