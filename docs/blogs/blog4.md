# Reflections on Building a Company That Cares

I really enjoyed today's lecture so a big thank you to Lyel! He brought up some really interesting topics but one that I still kind of struggle with is how do you make a big successful company that actually cares? A company that truly does prioritize ALL of its stakeholders. 

When thinking about big tech companies these days, you have your Google’s and your X’s, and Snapchat’s and Reddit’s and countless others. However at their inception, I would find it hard to believe that their founders were considering how their app would affect people. Now I know it's hard to think about all the possible effects of social media and I’m sure if you asked any of the founders of these big tech firms, they would tell you that their goal was never to have social media be harmful. I would argue however that by giving the freedom to the users almost inherently leads to things that can’t be controlled which can lead to negative effects. While I am not saying that there is nothing that these big companies can do, I am saying it is extremely hard to control what users post especially if these companies want their apps to become wildly successful as many of them have. 

Now there are plenty of companies that do focus on their users as Lyel brought up in lecture but from my experience, the overwhelming majority focus on producing an app and prioritizing clicks and money and exposure. Then once the app has become mainstream and popular and problems start arising, then the founders and CEOs will start to realize that things need to be addressed and will finally start thinking about the user. Finding the sweet spot that does prioritize all stakeholders does seem possible but how feasible it is, I am not sure. However, as Lyel mentioned at the end of lecture this is what makes building an app all worth it. When you find that sweet spot that does prioritize your values that you had when you started your project, then you truly have something that you are proud of and something that can help the world \:)
