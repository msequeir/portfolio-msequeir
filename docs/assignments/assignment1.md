## A1

#### Hunch

Before interviewing, I wanted to explore how music and sound play a role in social media, especially in retention rates for certain social media apps. Everybody always asks me “Do you know the sound clip I’m talking about?” or “Do you know that song from TikTok?”. 

#### Interview Planning

**Justification for Choosing Interviewees:**  
- **Interviewee A**:
    - **Reason for Choice**: A is a prime candidate because she is a few years older than college students, and primarily because she’s from South America and offers a perspective shaped by a different cultural background. Additionally, she has a strong personal connection to music and the arts (guitar, piano, singing), which aligns with my hunch about how music influences social media use.   
- **Interviewee B**:
    - **Reason for Choice**: My brother is a few years older and has a more utilitarian approach to social media, such as using TikTok for recommendations and Reddit for informative content. His interests differ from mine, and he definitely uses social media a lot differently than I do. 

**Questions and Follow-Ups** 

- **Q0**: “How does your social media usage fit into your daily routine? Do you find that it serves a specific purpose for you, like staying connected, getting inspired, or passing time?”
    - **Follow-up**: “Are there certain times of day or situations where you use social media more often?”
    - **Follow-up**: “Do you feel that social media helps or hinders your productivity or mood throughout the day?”
- **Q1**: “When you use social media, how important is sound or music in your experience?”
    - **Follow-up**: “Can you think of any recent sounds or songs that impacted your experience? How did it make you feel?”
- **Q2**: “On Instagram, do you think the music or sound attached to a reel affects how much you engage with it?”
    - **Follow-up**: “Have you ever watched a reel multiple times just because you liked the sound or song?”
    - **Follow-up**: “Do you ever search for a reel just to hear a specific sound or song again?”
- **Q3**: “Can you tell me about a sound or song that you first discovered on social media? How did it affect your experience?”
    - **Follow-up**: “Did you later look up that song / add it to your playlist?”

#### A Interview Recap

The first person I interviewed was my friend A. A was a prime candidate to interview because she is a few years older and was born and raised in South America. Having the ability to chat with her was amazing especially considering her upbringing in South America and how she has a totally different perspective than I do about many facets of life. Additionally, I thought she would be a target person for my hunch because she loves music and plays the guitar and piano and she sings. As it turns out, our conversation did not focus on music at all! She told me that the social media apps she uses the most are actually Pinterest and Instagram in that order. I was a little shocked when she said Pinterest was her number one app considering the popularity of other social media apps that people use so I asked her some follow-up questions. She uses Pinterest for a multitude of things with her primary uses being:
1. inspirational quotes 
2. outfits 
3. hairdos.  
  

I was intrigued to hear that she uses Pinterest mainly for quotes but it makes sense knowing her personality. She read one of her favorites quotes from her saved page on Pinterest:

> “‘Why are you so nice even to people who are rude to you?’   
> ‘Because I too have been rude to nice people and I know that rudeness comes from a place of roaring pain, and only kindness soothes it.’" 


Firstly, it is a very inspiring quote. Secondly, people can edit the quote on a background that reflects the tone or gives off a certain vibe which she really likes. Thirdly she told me she likes to hang quotes like this around her room. This is the major appeal of Pinterest that I got from her, the ability to take inspiration from other people’s designs to design something personal to you. She does the same thing with outfits and hairdos as well. 

Lastly, we talked a little bit about what she does on Instagram and why she deleted TikTok. She likes Instagram reels that include animals and she mainly watches those with funny sound clips, especially funny voiceovers. TikTok used to be her most used app until she decided that she felt “addicted” and that it was taking too much of her time. 



#### B Interview Recap

The next person I interviewed was my older brother B. B graduated from school a few years ago and was a really good person for me to interview because our social media uses are very different. He told me about his social media uses with his primary app being Instagram specifically the reels portion of the app. The main videos that will capture his attention or those that are funny or related to things he likes (sports, stats, soccer, etc).  A good gauge to see if he would watch a reel or not is based on the number of likes on the reel. He also said “I trust the Instagram algorithm” which I found pretty funny. Once he decided to watch a video I asked what makes or breaks the reel. He actually did say that audio plays a very big role in his enjoyment of a reel which did not surprise me since this is true for most of my friends as well. Sound clips that go viral and are played in the background are part of some of his favorite videos. Additionally, he said for other reels the speed and editing of a song can make a huge difference. Songs that are sped up really fast and made super high-pitched make videos much funnier while other songs are associated with “tough edits”.  One of my favorite things he said was “Instagram makes you think songs are good until you listen to the full thing” which is a similar sentiment that I have heard from my other friends as well.   

He also told me that he uses TikTok for recommendations especially if he is traveling. He said TikTok is great for restaurant suggestions or just ideas for what to do in certain areas since more people post these types of videos on TikTok. Additionally, he told me that he decided to take a trip to a national park because of a video he saw on TikTok. 
Lastly, the final app we talked about was Reddit. He really likes Reddit because of how informative it is. Some of the things he used it for were studying advice for his CPA exams or fantasy football advice. The fantasy football usage surprised me because I feel like you can get fantasy football advice from major sports apps so I asked him what were the advantages of using Reddit. He said that Reddit is really good for “original content” which is “better than mainstream advice because it just gives him a different perspective.” The final thing he mentioned was that Reddit has some intriguing questions that “really make you think” which he likes to read in his spare time. 



#### Design Opportunities 

1. **Personalized Travel and Food Suggestions Based on Content Consumption**  
- Design a feature that connects users’ content preferences (e.g., national park videos or mac and cheese recipes) with actionable recommendations. For example, if a user frequently watches videos about national parks, the app could suggest travel destinations or itineraries. Similarly, for users who engage with food content, the app could recommend nearby restaurants. These recommendations could combine, offering travel and food suggestions tailored to users' interests when a user is planning a trip.
    - **Why it matters**: Interviewees like B already use social media for travel ideas, while A looks for inspiration. This feature enhances that experience by providing personalized, curated suggestions based on content consumption, increasing engagement and retention.

2. **Design Recommendations Based on Online Shopping Activity**  
- Create a feature that offers personalized room design ideas based on users’ online shopping activity. For instance, if someone is browsing for dorm essentials on Amazon, the app could analyze their preferences and suggest room designs or decor ideas that align with their taste and purchases. This feature would leverage users' browsing history and product preferences to provide tailored design inspiration, making it easier to visualize how their purchases fit into a cohesive design.
    - **Why it matters**: A’s use of Pinterest for outfit and room inspiration suggests that people enjoy personalizing their space with ideas from social media. This feature builds on that behavior, offering design suggestions tailored to users’ shopping habits, making the process of designing a room more convenient and personalized.

3. **Viral Sound Clip Suggestions for Video Editing**  
- Develop a feature that suggests viral or trending sound clips to users while they are editing videos. The app could analyze the content of the video (e.g., mood, theme, or context) and recommend sound clips or songs that fit based on current viral trends. This would help users easily find the right music or audio to enhance their content and potentially increase its appeal and reach.
    - **Why it matters**: B mentioned how the right sound can make or break a reel, and viral audio plays a big role in content popularity. This feature could streamline the editing process for users by recommending relevant, trending sounds, helping creators increase engagement and make their videos more shareable.

4. **Content Detox Mode to Manage Social Media Addiction**
- Design a feature that allows users to enter a “detox mode” for a more mindful and demure social media experience. This could reduce overwhelming, addictive content (like TikTok's rapid-fire videos) and instead prioritize calming, enriching, or inspirational posts based on user preferences. For example, users like A, who deleted TikTok due to feeling addicted, could opt for a tailored content feed that limits exposure to high-engagement, time-consuming content and promotes more balanced interactions (like inspirational quotes or soothing visuals).
    - **Why it matters**: A mentioned quitting TikTok because it felt addictive, a sentiment echoed by many users who struggle with balancing social media use. My brother also doesn’t use TikTok because he worries about time usage. By offering a more intentional browsing experience, this feature could help platforms retain users who might otherwise quit due to overwhelm, improving both mental well-being and long-term engagement.
